# Slack Clone - Product Requirements Document

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
Build a comprehensive team collaboration platform that enables seamless communication, real-time collaboration, and team connectivity through messaging, voice/video huddles, and rich interactive features.

## ðŸ‘¥ Target Users

### Primary Users
